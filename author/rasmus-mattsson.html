            <h2 class="entry-title">Global Competence Hub, Ericsson AB</h2> 
            <p><em>Title:</em> Integration Engineer<br />
<em>Period:</em> 2013 - Now</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In the Global Competence Hub, Rasmus worked in a large project to automate
fault management of network nodes in Ericssons managed services programme. The
automation was implemented by providing a framework in which repair procedures
could be easily be constructed in a graphical programming language. The repair
procedures would then automatically run on specific error conditions in network
nodes.</p>
<h3>Example of Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of a proxy mechanism in CORBA that could route traffic from an
Ericsson managed network through a demilitarized zone into a managed operator
network and back. This mechanism enables communication with network nodes.</li>
<li>Packaging of components for installation with RPM, the Red Hat Linux package
manager.</li>
<li>Implementation of a Continuous Integration framework for the solution in
Python.</li>
</ul>

            <h2 class="entry-title">Domain Competences</h2> 
            <h3>Backend Programming</h3>
<p>Most of his professional career Rasmus has spent writing backends that runs on 
various Unix and Linux platforms. He has good knowledge of
both Java and Python commonly used in this domain as well as agile methodologies and test driven development (TDD). </p>
<h3>Mobile Application Development</h3>
<p>Rasmus has been working professionally with Mobile Application Development for
about three years, developing a VoIP and chat client for three different
platforms: Android, Blackberry and Symbian. Although two out of these three
platforms are (almost) not used today they provided Rasmus with a solid
understanding of mechanisms that gives him an easy time to pick up new
technologies related to mobile application development at any time.</p>
<h3>Web Development</h3>
<p>Over the years Rasmus has (mostly out of curiosity)
developed a solid understanding fundamental web technologies such as
HTTP, HTML5, CSS and Javascript as well as common web utilities like
jQuery and Bootstrap. Rasmus is also good at handling GIMP, an advanced image
manipulation program and can to a degree create and modify his own graphical elements. </p>

<em>Period:</em> 2012</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>As a member of the DSP Quality and Efficiency team, Rasmus task was to provide the
DSP developers with a stable and efficient environment to work in. This
included design, development and maintenance of the scripts that provided the
environment itself as well as assisting users with problems.</p>
<h3>Example of Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integration of a new and all different component, the DC, in the existing
  Continuous Integration environment.</li>
<li>Assistance to users that had problems with the environment, either
  face-to-face or over a mailing list.  </li>

            <p><em>Title</em>: Mobile Application Developer<br />
<em>Period:</em> 2010 - 2012</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Rasmus was involved in the design and development of the mobile application
('App') that allowed two parties to communicate using voice or text with
end-to-end encryption. Rasmus learnt how to combine security requirements with
user friendliness and how to handle availability and VoIP in shaky mobile
networks with low throughput.</p>
<h3>Example of Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>An RTP implementation complaint with RFC 3550 and RFC 4867 for use on Android
  and Blackberry.</li>
<li>An SRTP/AES-CTR implementation complaint with RFC 3711 for use on Android and
  Blackberry. The code was certified for use on a RESTRICTED security level by an
  external party.</li>
<li>Design and implementation of a secure storage area for contacts in 32k of
  memory on an external device accessible from the Symbian platform.</li>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>As a Solution Integrator, Rasmus developed and installed customer specific
integrations in the customers radio network. A typical integration could be a
Java application, a script or a re-configuration of already installed
software.  Integration development was usually done in Gothenburg while the
installations were done at the customer site.</p>
<h3>Example of Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Development of customizations that were the final touch to a major network
  swapout project. Installed during two weeks on-site in Germany.</li>
<li>Developed a testing framework for a project related to FIFA World Cup 2010.</li>
<li>Performed life cycle management on a network node agent and installed it on
  site in England. </li>

            <h3>M.Sc Electrical Engineering</h3>
<p><em>Period:</em> 2003-2008</p>
<p>Rasmus has an M.Sc degree in Electrical Engineering from Chalmers University of
Technology. During the last year of his studies he specialized in communication
systems theory and signal processing. He made his master thesis at Ericsson in
Gothenburg where he implemented a network alarm simulator. </p>
<h3>Military Service as an Air Force Ranger</h3>
<p><em>Period:</em> 2002-2003</p>
<p>Although far from technical in nature, Rasmus learnt a life long lesson during
this time: To be able to perform a task, it can be whatever, in the warm
sunshine is a good start.  But in reality that is never the situation. It
always rains, and on top of that you will be hungry, deprieved of sleep and
carry 40 kg on your back. That is that situation that one must be prepare for.</p>
