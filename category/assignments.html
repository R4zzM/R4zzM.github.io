            <h2 class="entry-title">Global Competence Hub, Ericsson AB</h2> 
            <p><em>Title:</em> Integration Engineer<br />
<em>Period:</em> 2013 - Now</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In the Global Competence Hub, Rasmus worked in a large project to automate
fault management of network nodes in Ericssons managed services programme. The
automation was implemented by providing a framework in which repair procedures
could be easily be constructed in a graphical programming language. The repair
procedures would then automatically run on specific error conditions in network
nodes.</p>
<h3>Example of Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of a proxy mechanism in CORBA that could route traffic from an
Ericsson managed network through a demilitarized zone into a managed operator
network and back. This mechanism enables communication with network nodes.</li>
<li>Packaging of components for installation with RPM, the Red Hat Linux package
manager.</li>
<li>Implementation of a Continuous Integration framework for the solution in
Python.</li>
</ul>

user friendliness and how to handle availability and VoIP in shaky mobile
networks with low throughput.</p>
<h3>Example of Accomplishments</h3>
<ul>
<li>An RTP implementation complaint with RFC 3550 and RFC 4867 for use on Android
  and Blackberry.</li>
<li>An SRTP/AES-CTR implementation complaint with RFC 3711 for use on Android and
  Blackberry. The code was certified for use on a RESTRICTED security level by an
  external party.</li>
<li>Design and implementation of a secure storage area for contacts in 32k of
  memory on an external device accessible from the Symbian platform.</li>
