            <h2 class="entry-title">The Person</h2> 
            <p>During the last six years, Rasmus has the fortune to be able to make his living
of one of his hobbies in life: to program computers.<br />
'Curious' is a fitting one word description of Rasmus. He find most things 
that life has to offer interesting.<br />
He likes challenges and he is eager to learn new things.<br />
Rasmus interests aside from computers include: friends, workout, team sports,
juggling, drawing, reading and video games.</p>

            <h2 class="entry-title">Domain Competences</h2> 
            <h3>Backend Programming</h3>
<p>Most of his professional career Rasmus has spent writing backends that runs on 
various Unix and Linux platforms. He has good knowledge of
both Java and Python commonly used in this domain as well as agile methodologies and test driven development (TDD). </p>
<h3>Mobile Application Development</h3>
<p>Rasmus has been working professionally with Mobile Application Development for
about three years, developing a VoIP and chat client for three different
platforms: Android, Blackberry and Symbian. Although two out of these three
platforms are (almost) not used today they provided Rasmus with a solid
understanding of mechanisms that gives him an easy time to pick up new
technologies related to mobile application development at any time.</p>
<h3>Web Development</h3>
<p>Over the years Rasmus has (mostly out of curiosity)
developed a solid understanding fundamental web technologies such as
HTTP, HTML5, CSS and Javascript as well as common web utilities like
jQuery and Bootstrap. Rasmus is also good at handling GIMP, an advanced image
manipulation program and can to a degree create and modify his own graphical elements. </p>
